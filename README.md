# Packet Guided Infrastructure Optimization

## Presented at Sharkfest 2024 US

The internet operates using standards, and these standards were developed, debated, and ratified with the entirety of the internet in mind. But are these standards ideal for your environment?

The largest internet companies tune their servers to operate best in the environments they maintain. That tight control lets them reduce application response times even when latency might be high.

We will use packet captures to identify application traffic patterns and active network conditions, and weâ€™ll explore options to customize how servers put data on the network to fit the application and the network.
